ConnectToBacon:

This is the connection class that will do a postRequest to the server.
All classes in this folder should be in the using project.

Instructions:
	-The calling activity MUST implement the BaconUpdate interface!
	This means you must abide by the interface contract and implement
	the updateBacon() method in order to perform any actions on the UI
	thread with the results of the POST request.

	-The calling activity should also implement the CommandConstants
	and the ConnectionConstants interfaces. You will have access to
	macros when instatiating the ConnectionToBacon class and have much more 
	readable code.

		
	-To do a post resquest, from the calling activity do:
	
		new ConnectToBacon( <CommandConstant>,
				    <ConnectionConstant>, //this is the targetTable name
				    <HashMap of the data key/ value pairs>,
				    this ); //you need to provide a reference to the 
					    //the calling activity with the this keyword.


       -MAKE SURE THAT THE CALLING ACTIVITY IMPLEMENTS THE updateBacon() METHOD
       IN A MEANINGFUL WAY OR YOU WONT SEE THE RESULTS.
