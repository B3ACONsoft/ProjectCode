This is the demo for the post Requests.

Note:
	I compliled this with android sdk 23. You will need emulator
	or android hardware with that level to run it probably.
	I tested it on a nexus 7 and it works fine.

	
	This is pretty rough for sure. There is no input validation, the ui 
is crap but the idea is this: fill in the fields a hit "insert" to 
insert values into scotts database on the website. 
Hit "show all records" to see what is in the data base so far.
Results appear in an off center scoll field :)

Right now it posts to capstone1.netai.net/devDave/postDemo.php
and you can see the results on scotts page at capstone1.netai.net/devDave/GetCoaches.php.
