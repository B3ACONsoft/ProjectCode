    This Code will be useful adding a Coach or updating player records. The
    enrollment table now spits out the enrollment_id, user_id, and player_id
    every time you add someone successfully. Previously, it had been the
    users table and a name but that just isn't as useful.

    League Administration UI 75% Finished
    
    Spinners all operate properly, disappear slightly when they have no
    information to display. They take the needed information from the
    database and display it, after building a Hashmap that can eventually be
    passed somewhere or just used to switch items in the next method.

    Working SQLite DB
    
    The db is implemented in main. Any time you start a new activity, all
    you have to do is get a SQLiteDatabase object and call
    getWritableDatabase(), then use the object to query or select things
    with rawQuery for now...
